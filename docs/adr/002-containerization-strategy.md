# ADR-002: Containerization Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a deployment strategy that ensures:
- Consistency across environments
- Easy scaling
- Dependency isolation
- Quick disaster recovery

## Decision
We will use Docker containers with Docker Compose for orchestration.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Environment parity (dev/staging/prod)
- Easy horizontal scaling
- Simplified dependency management
- Built-in health checks and restart policies
- Easy rollback capabilities

### Negative
- Additional complexity layer
- Container overhead (~20MB RAM per container)
- Need Docker knowledge for troubleshooting

## Implementation
- Multi-stage builds for optimal image size
- Non-root user for security
- Health checks for all services
- Resource limits to prevent runaway processes
